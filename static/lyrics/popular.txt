Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her, yeah, she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised, oh

Oh, I know what she needs (oh-oh)
She just want the fame, I know what she fiends (oh-oh)
Give her a little taste, runnin' back to me (oh-oh)
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, every night (every night)
She prays to the sky
Flashin' lights
Is all she ever wanted

Beggin' on her knees to be popular
That's her dream, to be popular (huh)
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular (popular)
Just to be popular (uh-huh)
Everybody scream 'cause she popular (huh)

Yeah, shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular

I know that you see me (huh), time's gone by
Spend my whole life runnin' from your flashin' lights
Try to own it, but I'm alright (alright)
You can't take my soul without a fuckin' fight, oh

Oh, I know what she needs (oh-oh)
She just want the fame, I know what she fiends (oh-oh)
Give her a little taste, runnin' back to me (oh-oh)
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh (uh)
Ooh-ooh, every night (every night)
She prays to the sky (huh)
Flashin' lights
